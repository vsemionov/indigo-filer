; Indigo Filer can serve a virtual root directory that is composed of zero or more shares.
; This "virtual" root directory, that clients see, is not a real directory on the filesystem.
; Its entries are user-specified shares, which do not have to be located in the same parent directory.
; A share can be any filesystem object (file, directory, etc.). Every share has a unique name and a path.
; Shared objects do not need to exist on the filesystem - in that case they do not appear in listings,
;  and requests for them result in error responses.
; Shares are specified as settings in this section in the following format:
; <share-name> = <share-path>
; Share names may not contain the '/' character.
; NOTE: If Server.root (see above) is set to a filesystem path, the root directory listing
;  will contain entries of the real root, but requests with an URI other than "/" that match a share name
;  will be served from the matching share.
