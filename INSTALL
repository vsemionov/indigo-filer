INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

I. Windows
Either use the provided automated installer, or build from source.

To build from source, you will need:
 - MinGW and MSYS
 - POCO C++ Libraries

You will also have to edit the makefile in the main distribution directory to
match your system.

II. Unix
The procedure for building from source is essentially the same as for Windows.
After making small changes to the makefile, Indigo Filer may build under Unix.
However, Unix is not supported yet.
