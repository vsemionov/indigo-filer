GENERAL NOTES

Indigo Filer can serve a virtual root directory that is composed of zero or
more shares. This "virtual" root directory, that clients see, is not a real
directory on the filesystem. Its entries are user-specified shares, which do
not have to be located in the same parent directory. A share can be any
filesystem object (file, directory, etc.). Every share has a unique name and a
path. Shared objects do not need to exist on the filesystem - in that case they
do not appear in listings, and requests for them result in error responses.
Shares are specified as settings in the [VirtualRoot] section in the
configuration file with the following format:
<share-name> = <share-path>.
Share names may not contain the '/' character.
NOTE: If Server.root is set to a filesystem path, the root directory listing
will contain entries of the real root, but requests with an URI other than "/"
that match a share name will be served from the matching share.


KNOWN ISSUES

* A limitation in the POCO library prevents idle threads from being signaled to
terminate if a high connection rate suddenly drops to zero. To work around
this, you can use the Server.collectIdleThreads option. This is safe and works
in most cases, but is disabled by default, because it uses undocumented
behavior. Try enabling this option if the process often has a large number of
threads when new connections are not arriving. Even when this options is
enabled, idle threads will be signaled to terminate only when there are no
requests currently processed.
